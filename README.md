# CUDA-programs
A collection of GPU and high-performance computation programs written in CUDA.

Contains the following programs:
1. Parallelized matrix multiplication, transpose, and parallel reduction for Frobenius Norms (done)
2. Newtonian gravitational n-body solver using explicit Euler time integration (done)
3. Sparse linear system solver for discretized Laplacian convolution using parallelized Jacobi iteration (WIP)

For program 1, I received **2nd highest speed in class** for simple matrix multiplication AB, 8th place for transpose multiplication A^TBA, and 8th place for F-norm parallel reduction

Results of programs 2 and 3 have yet to be released.
